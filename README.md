[BLTools] Best Logs Cookies Checker by boyring


1. Cookie checker for many services - a unique check method that allows you to work without a proxy and at the same time your cookies remain alive. It finds a valid session and checks for all possible information, and also sorts it in a convenient order into different folders and text files. So that you can easily find what you need. Before checking cookies for validity, the program determines whether the required string for authorization is found, so the speed of work is very high. We do not waste time checking cookies that do not contain information for authorization and do not send unnecessary requests.
Services: Steam,Roblox,HumbleBundle,FreeBTC,Coinbase,HitBTC,KuCoin,Kryptex,Poloniex,YouTube,Twitch,TikTok,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,Netflix,Amazon (all countries),WordPress,PathOfExile,PSN,Genshin,Tarkov,GPay,Check letters (rambler.ru,gmail,yahoo),Discord Tokens Checker,Insta-Gaming,FunPay,Stake

✅UPDATE v1.9
* Fixed Instagram
* Fixed little things in Youtube,Steam,Roblox
* Amazon now checks not orders but transactions.
* Added BUFF163 (cookies must be fresh, because the session lives 10 days +-)
* Added Minecraft check. (beta version, check for skins will also be added in the next update)
* Added EpicGames check (balance, orders, code for checking for skins), in the next update we will send the check to the bot automatically.
* Telegram sorting has been changed in file sorting. Now saves only the profile folder instead of the entire log.
* Requests for check emails were previously only taken from Gmail. therefore Yahoo search did not work correctly. Fixed.
* Changed the check links of Crypto wallets, previously not all checks.
* More fixed all sorts of little things, I can’t even remember.

This is the first test update, soon there will be new services, they are already half ready, but I did not add them because they still work crookedly. Stake was removed, because it is not subject to fixing.
I REPEAT, THIS IS A BETA VERSION, ESPECIALLY FOR EPIC AND MINECRAFT.
